    "1. Are employees who worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to dissatisfaction? \n",
    "    - What about employees who have been there longer?\n",

    "# Extra\n",
    "```separationtype``` columns in each dataframe contains a couple of different separation types. For this project, only analyze survey respondents who resigned, so their separation type contains the string 'Resignation'\n",
    "If you are interested in a challenge, try to complete the project using all of the ```separationtypes``` instead - you'll find more issues to work through in the data cleaning process."
